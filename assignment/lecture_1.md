# What is Emmet?
It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code.//
Example - If I type 'html5' inside the 'index.html' then hit the enter key after that expand all the basic code inside html code.
# Difference between library and framework?
React is a small javaScript library. We can ipmorted like a javaScript file into our code and its give me super powers. We can use react in our Existing application projects, No matter it is using jQuery or it is using somthing else. If we have jQuery application--- no matter, We can import react and start using it.
Framework come with alot of baggage along with it, React does not come up with alot of baggage
